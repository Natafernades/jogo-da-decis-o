- Accent color: Medium light brown (#BCAAA4), used for interactive elements and highlights to contrast with the beige hues, but slightly brighter.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a serif, will give the application an elegant, intellectual, contemporary feel.
- Use icons that represent game elements and decision-making processes, with a modern and minimalist style.
- Design a clean and intuitive layout with a clear hierarchy to guide the user through the setup and game play.
- Implement subtle transitions and animations to enhance the user experience, making it feel more engaging and dynamic.
